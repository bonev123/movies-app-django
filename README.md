This is my final project for the Python Web Frameworks March 2022 Course @ SoftUni.

The app allows users to add movies to the database and photos related to them.The users can also like each others' photos they have uploaded.
Used technologies include - Django framework, HTML and some CSS.
Template reusability thanks to Django template inheritance.

Authenticated users have full CRUD functionality for all their created content.Mostly class-based views are used.
